        <p>
            Before we dive into the blocks themselves, we must talk about the types of statistical variables we can visualize.
        </p>

        <p>
            Table columns contain data that can be considered either <b>quantitative</b> or <b>qualitative</b> variables. We use the word <em>variable</em> here to indicate that you
            can treat the entire column like you would treat any one if its values when writing code.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>Quantitative</b> variables are <b>numerical</b> variables we <b>can</b> do arithmetic with. </li>
            <li> <b>Qualitative</b> variables are <b>categorical</b> variables we <b>can not</b> do arithmetic with </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This distinction between the two types of variables is important from a programming perspective when choosing which kind of visualization technique we should
            use to represent a given query's output.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each variable type can be further split into 2 subgroups:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>Discrete</b> quantitative variables are numerical variables whose values come in discrete units (i.e. the number of passengers in a taxi ride, number of
                students in a class, etc.)  </li>
            <li> <b>Continuous</b> quantitative variables are numerical variables whose values lie on some point of a continuous spectrum (i.e. cost of a taxi ride, GPA, etc.) </li>
            <li> <b>Ordinal</b> qualitative variables are categorical variables whose values <b>can be</b> ordered in some non-numerical way (i.e. level of education
                (elementary, middle, high, ...) , etc.)  </li>
            <li> <b>Nominal</b> qualitative variables are categorical variables whose values <b>cannot be</b> ordered (i.e. color of a taxi, political affiliation, etc.)  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For each data visualization block we cover in this assignment, we will also talk about which types of variables are associated with that visualization technique.
            It is always important to remember which types of data should be represented in certain ways.
