        <p>
            The <code>DROP</code> block is a block we can use to get a new Table containing most of the columns
            from the original Table. If you find that you do not need a particular column anymore, you can drop it from
            the Table.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Though you may commonly want to drop columns permanently (editing the Table instead of making
            a copy), to make the change permanent, you need to use a <code>set</code> block to overwrite the variable
            that contains your Table. Be careful when doing this, as any permanent action on a Table cannot easily
            be undone in Snap<em>!</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Table that results from a <code>DROP</code> block call has <b>at least the same number of columns</b>
            (if you dropped no columns), but <b>typically fewer columns</b> than the original table, and it will also
            have the <b>same number of rows</b> as the original Table. The order of the columns in the new Table will be
            the same as their order in the original Table, just with the dropped columns omitted.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>DROP</code> block takes in 2 arguments. These arguments are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A list of column names or indexes to drop (you can include both, but we recommend using only names or only indexes) </li>
            <li> A Table </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The <code>DROP</code> block has very similar behavior to the <code>SELECT</code> block, and in fact any
            query you can write with one you can write identically with the other. If you only want to exclude a small
            number of columns, you use <code>DROP</code>, but if you want to exclude a large number of columns (include
            only a few), you use <code>SELECT</code>.
