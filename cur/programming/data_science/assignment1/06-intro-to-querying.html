        <p>
            Now that we know how to make a Table and view it, we can begin to learn how to use them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using certain functions in DASIS, we can ask questions about a Table and receive answers.
            This process is known as <b>querying</b> a Table, which can involve asking about the Table's
            information or about the Table's stored data.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if we want to know how many rows or columns a Table has, we can use these blocks:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/num-rows.png" alt="Number of rows in Table" style="width:30%"/>

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/num-cols.png" alt="Number of Columns in Table" style="width:34%"/>
        
            <p style="clear:both";></p>
        </div>

        <p>
            As their names would suggest, these blocks tell us how many rows or how many columns a given Table has.
            If you try using these on your Table stored in
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/our-table.png" alt="our table variable" style="width:8%">,
            you have successfully completed your very first Table query!
        </p>

        <p>
            We can also ask questions about the data within a Table. For example, if we want all the data in a particular column, we can
            access it one of two ways. We can ask for a column based on its <b>name</b> or its <b>index</b>. Both can be useful
            in different situations, so DASIS provides you with the ability to do both:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/column-with-name-block.png" alt="Column data by name" style="width:38%"/>

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/column-by-index-block.png" alt="Column data by index" style="width:26%"/>
        
            <p style="clear:both";></p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The block on the left allows you to ask for a column by <b>name</b>, and the one on the right by <b>index</b>. Try using these blocks
            to see each column's data.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we want the information in a particular row, we can only access it by <b>index</b> because rows do not have names
            like columns do. Use the following block to get data by row:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/row-by-index.png" alt="Row data by index" style="width:25%"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            There are several other ways to query Tables, and we will cover new blocks that allow us to use those new ways going forward.
        </p>
